In week 3, we dive deeply into the structure of XML, and compare it to the structure of JSON.

* XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
* XML was designed to store and transport data in both a human and machine-readable manner.
* XML is a markup language much like HTML
* XML was designed to be self-descriptive

## Why Study XML?
XML plays an important role in many different legacy IT systems.
In the past, XML was often used for distributing data over the Internet. Today XML plays a role in configuration of software, and is often auto-generated by some kind of GUI. An example would be the XML that describes permissions for an Android application. Another notable example is SVG (scalable vector graphics) that are created by software like Illustrator or Inkscape.
 
It is important (for all types of software developers!) to have a good understanding of XML.

## What You Will Learn
This tutorial will give you a solid understanding of XML:

* What is XML?
* How does XML work?
* How can I use XML?
* What can I use XML for?

## Important XML Standards
This course will dig into some important legacy standards. These are organized according to the critical path, which is based on the five things you need to know for working with data structures and creating web services.
 
* XML AJAX
* XML DOM
* XML XPath
* XML XSLT
* XML XQuery
* XML DTD
* XML Schema
* XML Services

## XML Is Not Functional
Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not actually perform any kind of function.

A typical XML document:

```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Timbot</to>
  <from>Mila</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget our special weekend! ;)</body>
</note>
```

The document is descriptive, including a sender, receiver, heading and body.
 
But still, the XML above does not perform any function. XML is just information wrapped in tags.
 
Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it.

## The Difference Between XML and HTML
From the document above, we might note some similarities to HTML. However, XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

* XML was designed to carry data - with focus on data structure rather than presentation
* HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks and page format
* XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

This said, XML does use a similar element/tag structure to HTML and should be familiar to HTML developers. XML is often a complement to HTML, used for data structure, while HTML is used for display.
