## Exercise:

In week 3 you created an XML and JSON document that models the menu of a favorite restaurant. This week, you will validate that document in a variety of ways.

1. Validate the XML and JSON with an online validator
2. Create a DTD that validates your menu items
3. Create a schema that validates your menu items

_hints_

A schema document (XSD) is also valid XML, meaning you can actually validate your schema document!

- Your DTD must include an example of an entity

- Your schema must validate the data types for all of your nodes

- Compare simple.xml to simple_with_schema.xml in the examples

### Deliverables

When completed, you should have a menu.xml document inside your week4 folder. It should include a DTD that includes an entity. You should also have an XSD file that includes a schema for validating the datatypes for your nodes. Add, commit, and push this to your repo. Then create a pull request to merge your week4 work to the master branch.

Don't forget to work in a branch called 'week4'!
