## Exercise:

In week 3 you created an XML and JSON document that models the menu of a favorite restaurant. This week, you will validate that document in a variety of ways.

1. Validate the XML and JSON with an online validator
2. Create a DTD that validates your menu items
3. Create a schema that validates your menu items

Along the way you will get more used to using code versioning via git. Commit your XML, JSON, DTD, and Schema to your CPAN repository, in a folder called 'week4'.

Don't forget to work in a branch called 'week4'!
