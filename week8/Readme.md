# A Quick Summary

Time for some true talk.

Here are my stats for CPAN202:

* 64 commits
* 18 pull requests
* 12 issues created
* 9 issues closed out
* 10 videos created

My dashboard shows every single thing I've done for the course, and when I've done it. This is modern development, where everything is completely transparent.

But it isn't just me! The git server provides a constant feed of activity for every person participating. For everyone enthusiastically following along - thank you!

## Time to Check In

We have reached the mid-point of the semester, and it is time to think about what each of us wants as a result from this course.

On the one hand, there is a path that leads to you having a beautiful, tightly organized, well-documented body of work that demonstrates you are a modern developer, with a keen thirst for knowledge.

On the other hand, there is a tale where your work reveals a different picture - very few checkins, no consistent effort, no questions asked or issues created. Personally, I can tell you I would not hire that person.

By now, if you've been following the weekly updates, you'll understand that XML dropped out of favour as a web technology years ago. But it is still used in legacy systems. There is *huge demand* for people who can combine support for legacy XML with modern API techniques based on JSON. I can give you that - it's what I do.

*Let's summarize the path so far.*

The assignments in week 1 are about getting your development environment set up and getting used to using code versioning. I will tell you a truth:

 **If you can't use Git, you can't be a developer today. Full stop.**

 From week 2 to week 5, the lessons are about getting used to the format of XML, getting familiar with legacy systems, and understanding how people worked with that language. We create documents, validate them, parse and transform them. Along the way we see comparisons to the newer JSON format and learn about the similarities and differences.

 In week 6 and week 7, we start to get into real modern development. We start using the command-line, create a Node server, learn about a modern database, and get a taste of GraphQL - the standard that is rapidly taking over everything in web development.

 We do all of this with the goal of understanding how XML is *really* used today. In any modern development scenario, the real value is in supporting and transitioning XML services to JSON, and GraphQL provides the most beautiful method of doing so.

 So it's up to you to decide how much you want those modern development skills. Is the reward worth the effort?

 **We are in this together**

 If you have been dragging your feet up to now, this is really the time to make a change.

 Perhaps you've been intimidated to use Git. I will say it again - use of Git is not optional. No development environment that you will ever want to work in will accept a developer who has no knowledge of code versioning. If that is holding you back, I will help you! I will help you until it is working.

 Perhaps something has been unclear in the material or directions. *Ask me* about it! When any student flags an issue, I update the material so everyone can benefit. I make additional materials and provide them to everyone.

 If anyone, anywhere, asks me about what I've been doing for CPAN202 I can proudly show them precisely what I've accomplished. *You want to be able to say the same.*

## Coming Up

From this point on will be a straight flight to the target, which is to show that we can handle XML, and serve up a modern web service based on GraphQL that isn't reliant on any particular format.

At the end, your reward will be that you can rebase your repo up to Github, Gitlab, or any other community that uses Git. And all of your history will be preserved with it, convincing evidence to any smart employer that you are a smart pick.
