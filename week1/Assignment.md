Hello friends!

It's Timbot, your instructor for the exciting course on building web services (using XML!). I am preparing to upload content for the online course that I think you will enjoy. Meanwhile I have your first assignment, which is a very simple one. It is designed to help me get to know you and your programming ambitions. And it will open up communication between us - which is particularly important when working remotely.

Assignment: *Write a page to describe your background and your programming experience.*

To do this assignment well, think of specific details. What languages do you program in? Have you done any commercial work? Any volunteer assignments? How long have you been programming? Did you come to Toronto from elsewhere? What are your goals and ambitions for programming? Do you have a dream-project you would work on?

We have some flexibility in this course, because web services drive every imaginable software today. From communities, to utilities, to entertainment and education - web services are behind everything.

So let's get thinking about what we want to build!

## How to Complete

To complete assignments for the course, you'll need to get familiar with using Git.

Git is currently the most popular programming tool in existence, used by all sizes of development projects for tracking and versioning code.

To get started, visit oddlylabs.com and create an account. Once complete, request to be added to the "Humber" organization.

Create a new repository in your account called "CPAN202". Be sure to include "node" as the .gitignore template, and choose the MIT license. Allow the site to generate a default Readme.md file.

From your local computer, use git to clone the newly created repository.

Create a branch called "week1"

Update the Readme file to complete Assignment 1, by including information about your goals as a developer.

Add and commit the Readme file.

Push the branch to the remote repository.

Merge the "week1" branch into the "master" branch.
