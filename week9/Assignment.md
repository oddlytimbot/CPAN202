## Final Assignment! (weeks 9-13)

We are moving into the final assignment, which we will be doing together through weekly lessons that build on each other.

If you follow along, completing the assignments, you will successfully guide a fictional organization through the steps of modernizing an existing XML-based service into a JSON-based GraphQL endpoint.

A requirement from the organization is that the current XML based service can not be disrupted while the new service is being created - you'll need to keep it running and layer your GraphQL endpoint in front of it.

### Week 9 Expectations

You should use the xml you have created in previous weeks in the following steps. Examples have been provided to follow along with, but _you should have your own unique XML file_ and work through the following steps with it. In doing so, you will demonstrate:

- Using XSLT to transform an XML document (using Saxon)
- Using DTD to embed entities
- Using Schema for validation
- Converting XML to JSON
- Serving up XML data via REST API
- Serving up JSON data via REST API

## Coming up in week 10

In week 9 we get as far as REST services - currently a common standard. But this standard is rapidly giving way to the next interation of technology, that has significant advantages over it.

- Setting up a GraphQL endpoint

Good luck! Let's work together!
